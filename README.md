## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year student at UVA, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Data Science.

This github page includes projects and class work from my course curriculum and personal projects.

The starred repositories include final projects from various classes in the school of data science and one project from an internship.

Take a look at my Portal-players repository for a project I completed during my summer internship with a baseball team.
